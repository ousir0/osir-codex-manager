# Inject the macOS 26 (Tahoe) adaptive app icon into a built .app bundle.
#
# Tauri doesn't yet support the new .icon / Assets.car flow (tauri-apps/tauri#14979),
# so its bundler only ships a static .icns. This script compiles assets/icon.icon
# with actool and injects the result post-build, giving the app a Liquid Glass icon
# that follows the system appearance (Default / Dark / Clear / Tinted) on macOS 26.
# The static .icns stays in the bundle as a fallback for older macOS.
#
# Requires: Xcode 26+ (for actool). macOS only.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/macos-adaptive-icon.sh [path/to/App.app]
# With no argument, it patches the release bundle under src-tauri/target.
