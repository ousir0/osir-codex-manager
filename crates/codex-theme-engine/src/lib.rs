//! Asset-based UI themes for the official Codex desktop app.
//!
//! Rust port of codex-theme-studio's core: a theme is AI-generated bitmap
//! assets + CSS + a decorative chrome layer, injected into the running Codex
//! renderer over the Chrome DevTools Protocol (loopback only). **No app file
//! is ever modified, unpacked or replaced** — `app.asar` stays untouched and
//! the notarized signature stays valid; turning the theme off restores stock.
//!
//! Module map (1:1 with the studio's Node modules):
//! - [`theme`]  — theme-package loading/validation (`theme.mjs`)
//! - [`payload`] — renderer payload assembly + fingerprint (`payload.mjs`)
//! - [`cdp`]    — CDP client, target discovery and probing (`cdp.mjs`)
//! - [`native`] — `~/.codex/config.toml` appearance sections (`native-theme.mjs`)
//! - [`daemon`] — in-process keeper that re-injects across reloads/new targets
//!
//! The injected renderer runtime (`src/runtime/theme-runtime.js`) is the
//! studio's file verbatim — it encodes hard-won flicker/idempotence/route
//! discipline (see that file's comments) and must be edited there, not here.
